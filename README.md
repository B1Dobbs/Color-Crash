# Color-Crash
Color Crash is a mobile game with unity that combines a block breaking game with color theory. 

It starts out with just primary colors then slowly introduces secondary then tertiary to increase difficulty. The current level is Survival Mode wich will continue until screen fills up with blocks. 

Plans to expand include a color paint store and different play modes.
